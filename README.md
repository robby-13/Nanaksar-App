# Nanaksar-App

### Potential Functionalities

#### Integrate Dropbox Account
Allow for users to access the Nanaksar Dropbox Account without having to need to login.

#### Store Pictures of all Gurdwaras
Store more recent pictures of all 17 asthaans across the world. Include short history and any additional details regarding daily programs/events per asthaan. 

#### Access to all Social Media Channels
The app would serve as a central hub for all Nanaksar related social media accounts. All major accounts which host lives would be available to access from the app.

#### Jeevani Hub
Store Anand Chamatkar and Ishar Chamatkar in an easy-to-read format, a format which isn't like what is used across the board where only 6-7 lines are shown on each page and the user would need to turn pages. The idea would be to have a scrolling feature wihtout having to manually change pages.

#### Gutka
Store Nanaksar Maryada Sundar Gutka. Follow similar easy-to-read scrolling format used for the jeevanis. 

#### Calendar Feature
Store dates for Pooranmashi, Sangrand, Gurpurabs and other events celebrated at Gurdwara Nanaksar. The dates would change automatically once the event day passes. User can opt for notifications as the event approaches.
